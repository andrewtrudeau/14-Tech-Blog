## Instructions & Usage

Just open the heroku page and explore the different pages. You may notice that you are not allowed to go to the dashboard unless you are logged in. So create a user and then look at your dashboard. You can then make posts from the dashboard. Feel free to log out of one account and make another. This new account will not have anything in their dashboard until you make some posts. All posts are displayed on the Home page.
